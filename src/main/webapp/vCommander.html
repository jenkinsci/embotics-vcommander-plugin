	<h3>This plug-in enables Jenkins to interact with Embotics Commander.</h3>
	<div>
		<b>It provides the following build steps:</b>
		<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
			Request New Service<br/>
			Wait For Service Request Completion<br/>
			Run Command Workflow<br/>
			Wait For Command Workflow Completion<br/>
		</div>
	</div>


	<br/>
	<div>
		<b>Request New Service</b> build step enables Jenkins to request a service from Embotics Commander.<br/>
		To request a service (for example, a VM), enter the name of a preconfigured Commander service and look it up. If the service is found, it's returned as a JSON payload. You may adjust the configuration parameters of the payload as required. You may also modify the default timeout and polling intervals before making the service request.<br/>
		<br/>
		This action can be executed synchronously or asynchronously.<br/>
		If asynchronously execution is configured, a following wait build step can check the results of this step.<br/>
		<br/>
		After the request is made, the following environment variables are created:
		<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
			VCOMMANDER_REQUESTED_SERVICE_ID - the request ID<br/>
		</div>
		<br/>
		For a synchronous execution, the build log will provide details about the service request. If the request is successful, the following environment variables are created:
		<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
			VCOMMANDER_REQUESTED_SERVICEx_COMPONENTy_NAME - The deployed component name, where x is the service index and y is the component index.<br/>
			VCOMMANDER_REQUESTED_SERVICEx_COMPONENTy_TYPE - The deployed component type, where x is the service index and y is the component index.<br/>
			Indexes start from 1.<br/>
		</div>
	</div>


	<br/>
	<div>
		<b>Wait For Service Request Completion</b> build step enables Jenkins to wait for the completion of an asynchronously-called Commander Request.<br/>
		The environment variable VCOMMANDER_REQUESTED_SERVICE_ID created by that service request step can be used as input parameter for this wait build step.<br/>
		<br/>
		The build log will provide details about the service request. If the request is successful, the following environment variables are created:
		<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
			VCOMMANDER_REQUESTED_SERVICEx_COMPONENTy_NAME - The deployed component name, where x is the service index and y is the component index.<br/>
			VCOMMANDER_REQUESTED_SERVICEx_COMPONENTy_TYPE - The deployed component type, where x is the service index and y is the component index.<br/>
			Indexes start from 1.<br/>
		</div>
	</div>


	<br/>
	<div>
		<b>Run Command Workflow</b> build step enables Jenkins to run a command workflow in Commander.<br/>
		To run a command workflow, enter the name of the workflow and target.<br/>
		<br/>
		This action can be executed synchronously or asynchronously.<br/>
		If asynchronously execution is configured, a following wait build step can check the results of this step.<br/>
		<br/>
		After the workflow request is made, the following environment variables are created:
		<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
			VCOMMANDER_WORKFLOW_TASK_ID - the task ID running the workflow
		</div>
		<br/>
		For a synchronously execution, the build log will provide details about the command workflow.
	</div>
	

	<br/>
	<div>
		<b>Wait For Command Workflow Completion</b> build step enables Jenkins to wait for previous asynchronously called Commander Run Command Workflow completion.<br/>
		The environment variable VCOMMANDER_WORKFLOW_TASK_ID created by the previous step can be used as input parameter for this build step.<br/>
		<br/>
		The build log will provide details about the command workflow.
	</div>
	

	<br/>
	<br/>
	All the created environment variables can be used in subsequent build steps within the same project.

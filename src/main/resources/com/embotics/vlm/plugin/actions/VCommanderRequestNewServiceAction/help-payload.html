<div>
	When you lookup a service that exists in the Commander Service Catalog, the request configured for that service is displayed in this field as a JSON payload. For some service requests you may edit  configuration parameters. If you edit a service request's configuration parameters, you must use valid values for each configuration parameter and proper JSON formatting. Parameter validation is not performed.

	You may also use environment variables in the text. Regular Jenkins syntax will be used to resolve the variables - either $xyz, ${xyz} or ${a.b} but not $a.b, while ignoring "$".
